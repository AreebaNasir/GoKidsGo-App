# GoKidsGo-App  
## Introduction  
GoKidsGo is an android application inspired by the concept of introducing kids to e-learning at an early age as part of their learning experience. It targets schools that want to innovate their teaching process and change the traditional means of teaching as promoting and implementing e-learning at the kindergarten level is crucial to shaping children’s educational prospects positively.  

## Project Scope  
The primary goal of GoKidsGo is to provide young students (3-5 age group) with a wonderful platform for learning where they can seek new ideas and insights about topics. GoKidsGo will have striking colors and images which will help in increasing the engagement of little learners, as in practice, children are more motivated to learn when they see an interactive and colorful screen in comparison to a boring black and whilte image on paper. Moreover, children of the above age group are always attracted towards adventures so the application will also have interactive games according to the child’s intellectual level.
